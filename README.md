#I Love DIY


###[Live Demo](http://www.ilovediy.ninja)

I love DIY is a social platform for DIY enthusiasts to share their DIY (Do It Yourself) experiments. It is inspired by my super-handy husband who likes to build things himself. Users can publish posts, upload pictures, make comments, collect posts, and can use an "inbox" to send messages to each other. Of course, they also have the freedom to put somebody's messages into "Trash", or even block some other evil users from messaging them. So it is a fun place for DIY enthusiasts to share experience, learn tips, communicate with each other, and make friends.
