This is my final project. I am cloning instructable.com to build a web app for people to communicate about DIY experience.

I used rails, backbone, CSS and HTML to write this app, with Rspec to test each model.

The technologies I used in this app include:

Basic CRUD
Authentication
ActionMailer/Sendgrid
Partials, helpers
Routing
File upload (paperclip)
Omniauth
Backbone
Building my own API for consumption by Backbone
